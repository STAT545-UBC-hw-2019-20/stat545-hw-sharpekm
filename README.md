### A little bit about me 


#### Research


My name is Kimberly and I'm a PhD candidate in the School of Population and Public Health at UBC. I work with Dr. Chris McLeod based at the [Partnership for Work, Health and Safety](https://pwhs.ubc.ca/) 

I fancy myself multi-methods researcher. My dissertation is a quantitative study examining healthcare spending in workers' compensation systems and the relationship with return-to-work after work injury. I also lead a qualitative project of barriers and facilitators to return-to-work after work injury in the construction sector.

#### Personal


In my free time I'm usually: 

* Hiking & snowshoeing
* Snowboarding
* Crocheting & knitting
* Baking
* *Fawning over cute cats*
